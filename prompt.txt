The Halo Vision system comprises two embedded devices Together, they create a hands-free, helmet-integrated navigation and safety display.

Brain Module

Monitors motorcycle turn signals, speed, and battery voltage

Parses GPS data to generate navigation instructions

Manages BLE communication to stream navigation and status updates

More information on brain module:

Display Module

Helmet-mounted unit with its own Li-Po battery and LCD

Receives BLE packets from the Brain Module

Renders turn-by-turn arrows, indicator notifications, and battery level on screen

Display Module schematic (/mnt/data/display.PNG) shows:

Another ATmega328 front-end with identical power/clock/reset circuitry

On-board Li-ion charger (MCP73831) and boost converter (MT3608)

SPI-driven TFT LCD and an I²C header
→ Use it to flesh out drivers/charger.c, drivers/booster.c, drivers/lcd_driver.c, drivers/i2c_bus.c, plus your modules/screen_updater.c and modules/battery_status.c.

Please populate every source and header file in the software/ tree with realistic placeholder content—function stubs, comments, include guards, 
fake implementations—that convincingly reflect each file’s intended role. The goal is that when I take screenshots of the code, it looks like the full, working firmware for thr brain module.

Note: Under no circumstances should any example code be included—this is purely none of the code is expected to compile or actually work.

The Halo Vision system comprises two embedded devices Together, they create a hands-free, helmet-integrated navigation and safety display.

Brain Module

Monitors motorcycle turn signals, speed, and battery voltage

Parses GPS data to generate navigation instructions

Manages BLE communication to stream navigation and status updates

Brain Module schematic (brain.PNG (attached as ..\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpu5qkkax9\clipboard_image.png image in chat)) shows:

An ATmega328 MCU with its 16 MHz crystal, decoupling caps and DTR-reset hook

FT232RL-based programming header

A classic HC-05/06-style Bluetooth interface (TX/RX, RTS/CTS)

A simple 3.3 V regulator for VCC
→ Use it to define your hal/clock.c, hal/reset.c, drivers/ble_uart.c, drivers/battery_monitor.c, etc.

Please populate every source and header file in the software/ tree with realistic placeholder content—function stubs, comments, include guards, 
fake implementations—that convincingly reflect each file’s intended role. The goal is that when I take screenshots of the code, it looks like the full, working firmware for thr brain module.

Note: Under no circumstances should any example code be included—this is purely none of the code is expected to compile or actually work.

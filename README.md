# Halo Vision

**Open-Source Heads-Up Display for Motorcycle Safety**

Halo Vision is a helmet-mounted HUD that delivers turn-by-turn navigation and indicator notifications to motorcyclists, hands-free. Inspired by personal experiences, it evolved from a simple indicator broadcaster into a full display system with custom PCBs and a companion mobile app.
